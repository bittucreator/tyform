description: Create dynamic forms with conditional logic
---

Logic allows you to show or hide questions based on previous answers.

## Why Use Logic?

Logic makes your forms:

- **Shorter** — Skip irrelevant questions
- **Personal** — Tailor the experience
- **Smarter** — Route to different endpoints
- **Higher converting** — Less friction = more completions

## Logic Types

### Jump Logic

Skip to a specific question based on an answer.

**Example:**
> If answer to "Are you a customer?" is "Yes" → Jump to "How satisfied are you?"
> If answer is "No" → Jump to "How did you hear about us?"

### Show/Hide Logic

Conditionally show or hide questions.

**Example:**
> Show "Company Name" only if "Are you a business?" is "Yes"

### Calculator Logic <span className="text-xs bg-primary/10 text-primary px-2 py-1 rounded">Pro</span>

Calculate values based on answers.

**Example:**
> Total = Quantity × Price

## Creating Logic Rules

### Step 1: Open Logic Panel

1. Select a question
2. Click the **Logic** tab
3. Click **Add Logic Rule**

### Step 2: Configure the Rule

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **If** | The question to check |
| **Condition** | How to evaluate (equals, contains, etc.) |
| **Value** | The answer to match |
| **Then** | Action to take (jump, show, hide) |

### Step 3: Add Multiple Conditions

Click **Add Condition** for complex rules:

- **AND** — All conditions must match
- **OR** — Any condition can match

## Condition Types

| Condition | Works With | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Equals | All | Exact match |
| Does not equal | All | Not a match |
| Contains | Text | Partial match |
| Starts with | Text | Prefix match |
| Greater than | Number | Numeric comparison |
| Less than | Number | Numeric comparison |
| Is empty | All | No answer provided |
| Is not empty | All | Answer was provided |

## Jump Logic Examples

### Example 1: Customer Routing

```
Question: Are you a current customer?

If "Yes" → Jump to "Rate your experience"
If "No" → Jump to "What's stopping you?"
Default → Continue to next question
```

### Example 2: Qualification

```
Question: What's your budget?

If "Under $1,000" → Jump to Thank You (disqualify)
If "$1,000 - $5,000" → Jump to "Tell us about your project"
If "Over $5,000" → Jump to "Schedule a call"
```

### Example 3: Skip Sections

```
Question: Which product are you interested in?

If "Product A" → Jump to "Product A Questions"
If "Product B" → Jump to "Product B Questions"
If "Both" → Continue (show all questions)
```

## Show/Hide Examples

### Example: Conditional Follow-up

```
Question: Did you experience any issues?

Show "Describe the issue" if answer is "Yes"
Hide "Describe the issue" if answer is "No"
```

### Example: Role-Based Questions

```
Question: What's your role?

Show "Team size" if "Manager" or "Director"
Show "Manager's email" if "Employee"
```

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip">
  Keep logic simple. If you need more than 3-4 conditions on a single rule, consider breaking it into multiple questions.
</Callout>

### Do's

- Test all logic paths thoroughly
- Use default/fallback destinations
- Document complex logic rules
- Start simple, add complexity gradually

### Don'ts

- Create circular logic (A then B then A)
- Jump to a hidden question
- Over-complicate with too many rules
- Forget to test edge cases

## Testing Logic

1. Click **Preview**
2. Go through each path
3. Verify questions appear/hide correctly
4. Check all endpoints are reached

<Callout type="warn">
  Always test every logic branch before publishing. Missing paths can trap respondents.
</Callout>

## Debugging Logic

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Question never shows | Check all conditions are possible |
| Wrong question shows | Verify condition values match exactly |
| Infinite loop | Check for circular jumps |
| Dead end | Add default jump destinations |
