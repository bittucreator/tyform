Webhooks let you receive form submissions instantly in your own systems.

## What are Webhooks?

When someone submits your form, Tyform sends a POST request to your specified URL with the response data.

**Use cases:**

- Send data to your CRM
- Update your database
- Trigger automation workflows
- Send custom notifications
- Sync with external tools

## Setting Up a Webhook

1. Open your form
2. Go to **Settings** → **Integrations**
3. Click **Add Webhook**
4. Enter your webhook URL
5. Click **Save**

## Webhook Payload

### Request Format

```http
POST /your-webhook-endpoint HTTP/1.1
Host: your-server.com
Content-Type: application/json
X-Tyform-Signature: sha256=abc123...
```

### Payload Structure

```json
{
  "event": "response.submitted",
  "form_id": "abc123",
  "form_title": "Customer Survey",
  "response_id": "resp_xyz789",
  "submitted_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "answers": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "rating": 5,
    "feedback": "Great product!",
    "interests": ["Feature A", "Feature C"]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "completion_time": 120,
    "device": "desktop",
    "browser": "Chrome",
    "ip": "192.168.1.1",
    "country": "US"
  },
  "hidden_fields": {
    "user_id": "123",
    "campaign": "launch"
  }
}
```

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `response.submitted` | Form was completed |
| `response.partial` | Partial response (if enabled) |
| `form.published` | Form was published |
| `form.closed` | Form was closed |

## Security

### Signature Verification

Every webhook includes a signature header. Verify it to ensure the request came from Tyform:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifyWebhook(payload, signature, secret) {
  const expected = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(JSON.stringify(payload))
    .digest('hex');
  
  return `sha256=${expected}` === signature;
}

// In your endpoint
app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  const signature = req.headers['x-tyform-signature'];
  
  if (!verifyWebhook(req.body, signature, process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET)) {
    return res.status(401).send('Invalid signature');
  }
  
  // Process the webhook
  console.log('Received response:', req.body.response_id);
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```

### Webhook Secret

Find your webhook secret:

1. Go to Settings → Integrations
2. Click on your webhook
3. Copy the **Signing Secret**

<Callout type="warn">
  Never expose your webhook secret. Treat it like a password.
</Callout>

## Response Requirements

Your endpoint must:

- Respond with `2xx` status code
- Respond within 30 seconds
- Handle duplicate deliveries (idempotency)

## Retry Logic

If your endpoint fails, Tyform retries:

| Attempt | Delay |
|---------|-------|
| 1st retry | 1 minute |
| 2nd retry | 5 minutes |
| 3rd retry | 30 minutes |
| 4th retry | 2 hours |
| 5th retry | 24 hours |

After 5 failed attempts, the webhook is marked as failed.

## Testing Webhooks

  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
}
```

## Example Integrations

### Slack Notification

```javascript
app.post('/webhook', async (req, res) => {
  const { form_title, answers } = req.body;
  
  await fetch(process.env.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      text: `New response to "${form_title}"`,
      blocks: [
        {
          type: 'section',
          text: {
            type: 'mrkdwn',
            text: `*Name:* ${answers.name}\n*Email:* ${answers.email}`
          }
        }
      ]
    })
  });
  
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```

### Save to Database

```javascript
app.post('/webhook', async (req, res) => {
  const { response_id, answers, submitted_at } = req.body;
  
  await db.collection('responses').insertOne({
    _id: response_id,
    ...answers,
    createdAt: new Date(submitted_at)
  });
  
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```

### Send Email

```javascript
app.post('/webhook', async (req, res) => {
  const { answers } = req.body;
  
  await sendEmail({
    to: answers.email,
    subject: 'Thanks for your submission!',
    template: 'confirmation',
    data: answers
  });
  
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```

## Webhook Logs

View webhook delivery history:

1. Go to Settings → Integrations
2. Click on your webhook
3. View **Delivery Log**

Each entry shows:
- Timestamp
- Response status
- Response time
- Payload sent
- Response received

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| 401 Unauthorized | Check signature verification |
| 404 Not Found | Verify webhook URL is correct |
| 500 Error | Check your server logs |
| Timeout | Optimize endpoint performance |

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode to receive detailed error information in webhook responses.

<Callout type="tip">
  Process webhooks asynchronously. Accept the webhook quickly, then process in background.
