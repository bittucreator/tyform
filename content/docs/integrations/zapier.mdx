Automate your workflow by connecting Tyform to thousands of apps through Zapier.

## What is Zapier?

Zapier connects apps together through automated workflows called "Zaps." When something happens in Tyform (trigger), Zapier automatically does something in another app (action).

**Examples:**

- New response → Add row to Google Sheets
- New response → Create Notion page
- New response → Send Slack message
- New response → Add subscriber to Mailchimp
- New response → Create Salesforce lead
